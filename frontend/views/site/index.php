    <u><h1>Welcome to Standard Gauge Railway</h1></u>

    <p><b>      Under the East African Railway Master Plan, the Mombasa–Nairobi line will link up with other standard gauge railways that are being built in East Africa. Construction is already under way on Phase II of the Kenya SGR, which will extend the railway to the Uganda border by 2021.

     <b>The SGR begins at Port Reitz, just west of Mombasa Island. The line passes through the transportation corridor between Tsavo East National Park and Tsavo West National Park. As it approaches Nairobi, the railway crosses the 2.6 km long Athi River Super Bridge, which was the sixth-longest bridge in Africa at the time of its construction. The main station for Nairobi is at Syokimau, near Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.

    Phase 2 of the SGR will extend the Mombasa–Nairobi line to Naivasha, and eventually to the Uganda border. A connecting standard gauge railway is being built in Uganda by another Chinese state-owned company, providing landlocked Uganda with high-capacity railway transport to the sea.

        <div class="col-sm-3 ">
       <b> The new line runs generally parallel to the old Uganda Railway, a metre gauge railway built by the British in the late 19th century. However, the new line follows a straighter alignment than the original railway, which allows for higher speeds. Because of terrain, large portions of the railway are built on viaducts, embankments, and cuttings. For example, the metre gauge railway tackled the hilly terrain at Mazeras by using a spiral, but the SGR passes through the region on two bridges, with the 43.5-metre-high Mazeras-2 bridge being the highest one on the Mombasa–Nairobi route. There are a total of 98 bridges between Mombasa and Nairobi.
    Viaducts are also used for environmental protection.</b>

            <b>The highway and metre gauge railway pass between the Tsavo National Parks at ground level, which carries the risk of collisions with wildlife. Part of the SGR is elevated on viaducts, allowing wildlife to pass without risk of injury. The rest is elevated on embankments, and six underpasses have been constructed to allow wildlife to cross.
    Passenger services run from Mombasa West station to Nairobi South station in Syokimau, where passengers can transfer to the metre gauge trains into Nairobi city centre.Freight services are provided between Port Reitz and an inland container depot at Embakasi in Nairobi.
